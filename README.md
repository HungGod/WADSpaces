WADSpaces

Tested exclusively on Fedora, Linux and is likely broken at the current moment. Very early draft, clone at your own risk.

The goal of this project is to reimagine KasmVNC, with a more casual/hobbiest focus. Portable workspaces that isolate its activities from another, allowing you to self-host or stream from third party server your containerized video game/work desktop/hobby space to yourself or to a seperate device.

Currently in the project:

Custom browser that creates PWA-esque web applications from web urls.
